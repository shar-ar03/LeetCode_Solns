# 🚀 Striver's SDE Sheet – My Complete Solutions

This repository contains my structured solutions to [Striver's SDE Sheet](https://takeuforward.org/interviews/strivers-sde-sheet-top-coding-interview-problems/), organized by topic and difficulty. Each problem is solved progressively from:

- 🧠 Brute Force →  
- ⚙️ Optimal →  
- 🚀 Further Optimized (if applicable)

This approach ensures not only solving the problem, but mastering the patterns used in competitive coding and interviews.
